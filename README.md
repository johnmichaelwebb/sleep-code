README

All code is in python. The code has been tested using Spyder 4.0.1.  This version of Spyder uses: Python 3.7.6 64-bit | Qt 5.9.6 | PyQt5 5.9.2 | Darwin 19.6.0. 

Spyder can be downloaded in the Anaconda package. 

For each folder, the code and sample data is included. In general, from opening the .py file in Spyder you should be able to run the file and get outputs, usually .pdf files in that same folder. 

Pseudocode descriptions of the data analysis is described in the methods section of the accompanying manuscript. 

Most of the scripts take about 1 minute to run on a normal computer. The optogenetics bootstrap and photometry analysis take a bit longer, but still about under 10 minutes.
